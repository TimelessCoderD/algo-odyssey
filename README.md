# DSA Practice

This repository contains my complete Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice journey.

## Structure

- `arrays/` — problems on arrays
- `linked-lists/` — problems on linked lists
- `stacks-queues/` — problems on stacks & queues
- `hashmaps-strings/` — string and hashmap problems
- `recursion-backtracking/` — recursion and backtracking
- `trees/` — binary trees, BST
- `graphs/` — graph algorithms
- `greedy/` — greedy problems
- `dynamic-programming/` — DP problems
- `math-bit-manipulation/` — math & bit tricks
- `tests/` — unit tests for Python & JS solutions
