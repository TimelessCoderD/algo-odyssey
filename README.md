# 🚀 Algo-Odyssey

Welcome to **Algo-Odyssey** — my personal journey of mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
This repository contains structured practice, problem solutions, and notes inspired by classic resources like **Narasimha Karumanchi’s DSA book**, coding platforms, and interview preparation guides.

## 📂 Repo Structure

- `recursion-backtracking/` → recursion problems, backtracking
- `linked-lists/` → singly, doubly, circular linked list problems
- `stacks-queues/` → stack/queue basics + applications
- `hashmaps-strings/` → string manipulation, hashmap-based problems
- `trees/` → binary trees, BST, traversals
- `graphs/` → BFS, DFS, shortest paths, MST
- `greedy/` → interval scheduling, job sequencing, knapsack
- `dynamic-programming/` → classic DP problems (LCS, LIS, knapsack)
- `math-bit-manipulation/` → primes, gcd, xor tricks

Each topic contains:

- ✅ **Problem solutions** (Python, later JS/Java if needed)
- 📝 **Time & Space complexity notes**
- 🧪 **Unit tests** under `tests/`
- 📌 **Progress tracker in README**

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen core problem-solving skills
- Build consistency (2–3 hrs daily practice)
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Transition towards **cloud-ready performance engineer / full-stack developer roles**
